### FotoWalker

Initially though of as an utility to walk directory trees,
renaming files according to their metadata (date of
creation), changed project after finding jhead, which did
pretty much that.

This project now walks through a directory, looking for
duplicate files with the same md5 hash, and either prints
out a list of duplicates, or deletes the duplicates,
keeping the one with the lowest lexicographical name.
